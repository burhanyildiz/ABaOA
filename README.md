# ABaOA - Bi-Attempted Base Optimization Algorithm (ABaOA) Application Codes
 - The two C++ codes shared in this repository are the application codes of ABaOA on two hydrosystems. They were developed for research purposes.
 - The codes can be used with an appropriate citation to the article: Yildiz Burhan, Ulukok Mehtap Kose, Bashiry Vali (2023). Bi-Attempted Base Optimization Algorithm on Optimization of Hydrosystems. Water Resources Management
 - The detailed explanations of the applications, the results and the comparisons of the results with GA can be seen within the article.
 - Any comments about the codes can be shared with Burhan Yildiz via burhanyildiz23@gmail.com or burhanyildiz@mu.edu.tr.
